In lecture 295, Colt shows us how to drop an entire collection. This will be done when we dont have any really important data
saved in the collections and we can afford to lose them. 
Follow the steps to achieve this result:-
1. check the available DB's by executing "show dbs" in mongo console.
2. use <db name> to switch to that particular db.
3. show collections to check what collections are available.
4. db.<collection-name>.drop() to delete all the records in that particular collection.
5. execute db.<collection-name>.find() and verify that nothing gets returned as the file collection/table should be empty.
